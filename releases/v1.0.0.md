# xk6-subcommand-explore v1.0.0 is here! 🎉

This is the first public release of `xk6-subcommand-explore`, marking it ready for production use. This release includes the initial functionality along with significant improvements based on early user feedback.

## Overview

`xk6-subcommand-explore` is a k6 extension that adds an `explore` subcommand to help discover available k6 extensions from the official extension registry. It's designed to work with k6's Automatic Extension Resolution feature, allowing you to quickly find compatible extensions, filter them by type or tier, and view detailed information.

The extension provides both human-readable table output and machine-readable JSON output, making it suitable for both interactive use and CI/CD automation.

## Key Features

**Extension Discovery**
- **List all extensions** – Browse the complete k6 extension catalog
- **Filter by type** – Filter extensions by type: `javascript`, `output`, `subcommand`
- **Filter by tier** – Filter by extension tier: `official`, `community`
- **Combine filters** – Use multiple filters together for precise results

**Output Formats**
- **Table output** (default) – Human-readable tabular display
- **Brief output** (`--brief`) – Compact view showing only module and description
- **Detailed output** (`--detailed`) – Rich list view with repository URLs and metadata
- **JSON output** (`--json`) – Machine-readable format for CI/CD integration

**Intelligent Sorting**
Extensions are automatically sorted for optimal discoverability:
1. **By tier** – Official extensions appear first
2. **By type** – Ordered as: JavaScript, Output, Subcommand
3. **By module path** – Alphabetically within each category

**Customization**
- **No truncation** (`--no-trunc`) – View full descriptions in table output
- **Color support** – Automatic color detection with `--no-color` override

## Usage

**List all extensions:**
```bash
k6 x explore
```

**Show detailed information with repository URLs:**
```bash
k6 x explore --detailed
```

**Show compact view:**
```bash
k6 x explore --brief
```

**Show full descriptions without truncation:**
```bash
k6 x explore --no-trunc
```

**Output as JSON:**
```bash
k6 x explore --json
```

**Filter by type:**
```bash
k6 x explore --type javascript
```

**Filter by tier:**
```bash
k6 x explore --tier official
```

**Combine filters:**
```bash
k6 x explore --tier official --type javascript
```

**Process with jq:**
```bash
k6 x explore --json | jq '.[] | select(.tier == "official")'
```

## JSON Output

When using the `--json` flag, the output is an array of extension objects. Each extension object contains:

- `module` (string) – Go module path of the extension
- `tier` (string) – Extension tier: `official` or `community`
- `description` (string) – Brief description of the extension's functionality
- `latest` (string) – Latest version tag (e.g., `v0.1.0`)
- `versions` (array of strings) – All available version tags
- `imports` (array of strings) – JavaScript module import paths (for JavaScript extensions)
- `outputs` (array of strings) – Output type names (for output extensions)
- `subcommands` (array of strings) – Subcommand names (for subcommand extensions)
- `repo` (object) – Repository information including URL

## Build

Currently, you need to build a custom k6 binary with this extension to use the `explore` subcommand. Use the [xk6](https://github.com/grafana/xk6) tool:

```bash
xk6 build --with github.com/grafana/xk6-subcommand-explore@v1.0.0
```

In the near future, k6 will introduce subcommand support to the Automatic Extension Resolution feature, making this extension available automatically without requiring a custom build.
